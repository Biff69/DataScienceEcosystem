These operators include the plus sign (+) for addition, the minus sign (-) for subtraction, the asterisk (*) for multiplication, the forward slash (/) for division, and the double asterisk (**) for exponentiation. By using these operators, we can perform various arithmetic operations in Python, as we will see in the following examples."
